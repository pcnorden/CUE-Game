# CUE-Game

This program is just a "proof-of-concept" that you can play games on the corsair K95-keyboard.

This project used DarthAffe's CUE.NET wrapper to talk to the keyboard.

DISCLAIMER: This project was created in school, during breaks and lessions (I am already done in math), but due to the breaks in the middle of coding, this code will not be beatiful!

Take care!

Tested on:

Windows 10, 64-bit, Corsair K95

Windows Server 2012 R2, 64-bit, Corsair K95
